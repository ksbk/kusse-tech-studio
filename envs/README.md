# Environment Configuration

This directory contains environment-specific configuration files.

## Usage

1. Copy the appropriate environment file to the project root as `.env`
2. Update the values with your specific configuration

## Files

- `.env.development` - Development environment settings
- `.env.staging` - Staging environment settings
- `.env.production` - Production environment settings

## Security

Never commit actual environment files with secrets to version control.
These template files use placeholder values that should be replaced.
